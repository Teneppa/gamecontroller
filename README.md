# gamecontroller
This is a code for my game controller. You can check the project from my website:
teukka.webnode.com

The gamecontroller_receiver_w_keystrokes is ment to be used with Arduino Leonardo as the receiver.
The gamecontroller code is ment to be used with ATmega328P (I'm using Arduno Pro Mini, 3.3 V and 8 MHz) as the transmitter.
